# Robust Depth Estimation for Light Field Microscopy

This is a Matlab implementation of the procedure described in the Robust Depth Estimation for Light Field Microscopy paper.

It combines vision cues to estimate accurate and robust depth maps from light field microscopy images. Images are acquired with FiMic microscope or created with Blender.
